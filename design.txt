build an N bit pc from scratch
really make it dynamic?

how to run efficiently?
	each 'component' should have multiple levels of operation?  'compile' low level components into functions/lambdas?

how to label, hook-up everything?

simulate a physical breadboard?

clock!

git
tests


how to avoid magic?  cna we use wires instead of grabbing and setting values between outer shell and inner components
could give each input a global id...
so 'magic' only happens at the lower level - physical devices
